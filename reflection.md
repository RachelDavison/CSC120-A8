- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

I overloaded the constructors for House and Library to add the elevator, because it feels important to anticipate people not remembering to add all the attributes, and the elevator is the most easily overlooked. I overloaded the Cafe constructor to account for not including the number of floors, since most Cafes have only one floor. I overloaded the Library returnBook() method to account for people returning damaged books, and the addTitle() and removeTitle() for more than one book at a time, the House moveIn() and moveOut() methods to account for groups of people moving in and out, and the Cafe sellCoffee() method to account for people not specifying the amount of sugar and cream.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Overloading and overriding themselves were fairly straightforward, but I did have issues with the Building ArrayList for the CampusMap turning my different types of Building into just the base Building, which stopped me from being able to use the subclass methods. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to do the exploring the campus map loop, because I found it a lot of fun!
